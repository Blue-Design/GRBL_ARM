WARNING THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS AND CURRENTLY DOES NOT COMPILE

We have gone for the Texas Instruments Tiva C Launchpad TM4C123G ( http://www.ti.com/tool/ek-tm4c123gxl ) because of its price and its capabilties.

It is an ARM Cortex M4F based microcontroller.

Features Include :

80Mhz CPU
256KB Flash
32KB RAM
2KB EEPROM
Floating Point Unit
24 Timers
43 GPIO Pins
12bit ADC


I am using KEIL MDK-ARM Lite ( free version ) to develop and flash to the board
